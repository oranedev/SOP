# Data Collection Agency - Camera Capture KPIs

This document outlines the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for assessing the performance of camera systems used in highway vehicle data collection. Each KPI is critical for evaluating the efficiency, accuracy, and reliability of the data collection process.

## KPIs Overview

The following table represents the KPIs used for monitoring and analyzing the camera capture system:

| KPI | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| Date and Time of Capture | Records the specific date and time each vehicle is captured. Helps in identifying traffic patterns and camera efficiency. |
| Vehicle Count | Total number of vehicles captured during a specific timeframe (hourly, daily, etc.). |
| Average Capture Time | Average duration for the camera system to capture and process an image of a vehicle. |
| Capture Success Rate | Percentage of vehicles successfully captured out of total vehicles passing the point. |
| Error Rate | Percentage of captures that failed or were unusable due to issues like blurring or overexposure. |
| Peak Hour Analysis | Analysis of hours with the highest traffic and camera performance during these periods. |
| Camera Downtime | Duration when the camera system was non-operational or under maintenance. |
| Data Transmission Time | Time taken to transmit captured data to the central processing system. |
| Data Accuracy Rate | Accuracy of captured data, including vehicle classification and license plate recognition. |
| Response Time to Issues | Average time taken to respond and resolve technical issues with the camera system. |
| Customer Satisfaction | Feedback metrics, particularly if data is used for client services. |
| Cost Per Capture | Total cost involved per vehicle capture, including equipment and operational costs. |
| Environmental Factors | Environmental conditions impacting camera performance, like weather conditions. |

## Data Representation

- Each row in the spreadsheet represents a different time interval or camera (if multiple cameras are used).
- Columns are dedicated to each KPI for systematic tracking and analysis.
- Charts or graphs are implemented for visual insights into trends and performance over time.

## Usage and Interpretation

- This data helps in optimizing camera system performance, scheduling maintenance, and improving overall data collection quality.
- Regular analysis of these KPIs ensures timely identification and resolution of issues, leading to enhanced operational efficiency.

**Note**: The KPIs are subject to change based on technological advancements and operational requirements.
